# NFLGreenRide üèà
A mobile application developed by PSU to help combact the amount of CO2 emission when commuting to NFL games

## Overview
Our proposed solution focuses on the development of a ride-sharing app specifically tailored for NFL fans attending games at the same stadium. This innovative platform will encourage fans to share rides by offering a compelling incentive system where users can earn points for every ride shared. These points can then be redeemed for NFL tickets, merchandise, and exclusive game-day experiences.

## App on iPhone 15 Simulator
